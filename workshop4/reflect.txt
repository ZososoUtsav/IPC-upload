Answer no1.
-> Code formating is important to make my code easy to read and maintain I followed best practices for 
conding style like using a clear and descriptive name for variables. using comments to comment out the logic and 
its purpose. I used meaningful and concise conditional statements. I also compiled and ran the code after i complete 
each logic so that i could catch the bugs in my program earlier.


Answer no2.
-> Nested logic is an imprtant feature of programming languages. If there were no nested looping it would make 
programming more complex. Because to get the same functioning logic like loops and nested loops we would have to create
the entire logic ourselves which would be very complex and not practical.

Answer no3.
-> If we used only if statements the code could become very hard to read and the logic would not be understandable. 
It would be more time consuming for the reader and also to maintain the code. Adding and modifiying would also be 
very complex if there were no if/else if statements. Each "if" statement would require the code to evaluate its condition,
even if the previous "if" statements have already determined that the conditions are not met. If/else if.. alternative
path makes code more readable, effiecient and maintanable than if optional path construct
